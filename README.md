# StudyTime
A simple anti distraction extension for google chrome. It came to be during a small hackathon with the topic of digitizing school life in Germany. While it may not be the most original idea, its goal was mainly to fight the notion that the internet was unsuited for studying purposes due to the large amount of distractions it offers.

If you want to try it out, you can follow the instructions below. We never came around to really finishing/polishing it, so don't expect too much.

## Installation

1.  Clone/download the repository and save it to a location of your liking.
2.  Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer Mode.
3.  Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and select the root directory of StudyTime.
4.  Thats it, enjoy!
